# Class snake, - length, powerups - dictionary, speed, 

# Sure, here are some ideas for the snake game:

# Add different levels with increasing difficulty, such as faster snake movement or more obstacles.
# Allow the player to choose the snake's starting length and movement speed.
# Add power-ups that the player can collect to temporarily increase the snake's speed or make it invulnerable to collisions.
# Implement a scoring system that rewards the player for collecting food and penalizes them for collisions.
# Add different types of food that give different bonuses or penalties (for example, a superfood that increases the snake's length by 2, or a poison food that reduces the snake's length by 1).
# Add multiplayer mode, where players can compete against each other or cooperate to reach a high score.
# Add different skins or themes that player can unlock or choose to customize their gameplay experience.
# Implement a pause and save functionality.
# Please let me know if you need more information or have any questions about these ideas.



# 1. Overview
# The goal of this game is to create a classic snake game in which the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food and growing in size. The player must avoid running into the edges of the screen or the snake's own tail.

# 2. Gameplay
# The game will start with a snake of length 3, which will move in one direction (up, down, left, or right) determined by the player.
# The player will use the arrow keys on their keyboard to control the direction of the snake's movement.
# The snake's movement will be continuous, with the snake's head moving in the chosen direction and the rest of its body following behind.
# The snake's length will increase by one segment each time it collects a piece of food.
# The game will end when the snake runs into the edge of the screen or its own tail.
# 3. Technical requirements
# The game should be implemented in Python.
# The game should be able to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
# The game should be able to run on a standard computer with no additional hardware requirements.
# The game should use the Pygame library for graphics and user input.
# 4. Deliverables
# The complete source code for the game.
# A working executable for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
# A document describing how to run the game and any known issues.
# 5. Timeline
# Initial development should take approximately 2-3 weeks
# Testing and bug fixing will take 1-2 weeks.
# Final delivery should be done within 1 week of the completion of development and testing.
