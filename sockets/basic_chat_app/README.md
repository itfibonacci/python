# Chat App Requirements Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a simple chat application using Python and sockets.

### 1.2 Scope
The chat application will facilitate real-time communication between multiple clients through a central server. The focus is on simplicity, with basic features for sending and receiving messages.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Server

#### 2.1.1 Connection Handling
- The server must be able to accept incoming connections from clients.
- Each client connection should be handled in a separate thread.

#### 2.1.2 Message Broadcasting
- The server must broadcast messages from one client to all connected clients.
- Messages should be sent in plain text format.

#### 2.1.3 Error Handling
- The server should handle errors gracefully, such as unexpected disconnections.

### 2.2 Client

#### 2.2.1 Connection to Server
- Clients should be able to connect to the server by specifying the server's IP address and port.

#### 2.2.2 Sending Messages
- Clients should be able to send text messages to the server.

#### 2.2.3 Receiving Messages
- Clients should be able to receive messages broadcasted by the server.

#### 2.2.4 User Interface
- A simple command-line interface will suffice for this basic version of the application.

## 3. Non-functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- The application should handle a moderate number of concurrent connections (e.g., 10-20 clients).

### 3.2 Reliability
- The application should be reliable and able to recover gracefully from unexpected errors.

### 3.3 Usability
- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, considering the target audience of developers and technical users.

### 3.4 Portability
- The application should be platform-independent and runnable on various operating systems.

## 4. Constraints

- The application will be developed using Python and the standard `socket` module.
- Security features, such as encryption and user authentication, will not be implemented in this basic version.

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Support for user authentication.
- Encryption of messages for improved security.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Support for additional features such as private messaging and file sharing.

## 6. Approval

This requirements document is subject to review and approval by the project stakeholders.
